## Work Management

[Teams](https://github.com/orgs/dogadopt/teams):
- The first component of the organisational hierarchy below the github organisation.
- Within teams the repositories owned by that team should be declared under the repositories tab.
- Within the discussions area of each team there should be a pinned discussion declaring the teams mission.

[Project](https://github.com/orgs/dogadopt/projects):
- Each project maps to a team and allows them to function in the most effective manner for their area. 
- Each project ReadMe should be kept up to date to state how that team works within that project. 
- Currently there is an outstanding **[issue](https://github.com/community/community/discussions/31678)**  signifying thre is no way to make a team own one of the new projects in github.
